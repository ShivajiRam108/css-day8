<!-- Objective: Use the flex-grow property to control how much space a flex 
child should take when compared to other children. 
- Create a div container with three child div elements.
 - Apply Flexbox to the container. 
 - Set flex-grow: 1 for the first child, flex-grow: 2 for the second child, and flex-grow: 0 for the third child. 
 - Observe how the second child grows twice as fast as the first one, and the third child does not grow. -->
